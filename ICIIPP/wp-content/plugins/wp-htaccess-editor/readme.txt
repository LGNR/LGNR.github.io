A safe & simple htaccess file editor with automatic htaccess backups & htaccess file syntax testing.

== Description ==

<a href="https://wphtaccess.com/">WP Htaccess Editor</a> provides a **simple, safe & fast way** to edit, fix & test the site's htaccess file from WP admin. Before saving, htaccess file can be tested for syntax errors. It also automatically creates a htaccess backup every time you make a change to the htaccess file. Htaccess backups can be restored directly from the plugin, or via FTP if the errors in htaccess file prevents WP from running normally. Great for fixing htaccess errors. For all questions, including support please use the official <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-htaccess-editor">forum</a>.

Access WP Htaccess Editor via WP Admin - Settings menu.

**If you're having problems with SSL or HTTPS try our free <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-force-ssl/">WP Force SSL</a> plugin. It's the easiest way to enable SSL and fix SSL problems.**

#### Testing Htaccess Syntax

Use the "test before saving" button to test htaccess file syntax before saving. Please note that this test does not check the logic of your htaccess file, ie if the redirects work as intended. It only checks for syntax errors. If you need to fix htaccess file we suggest restoring it to the default version and then add custom code line by line.

#### Automatic Htaccess Backups

Htaccess Editor makes automatic backups of htaccess file every time you make a change to it. Backups are located in `/wp-content/htaccess-editor-backups/` and timestamped so you can easily find the latest htaccess backup and restore it.

#### WordPress Network (WPMU) Support

WP Htaccess Editor is fully compatible and tested with WP Network (WPMU). It shows up under the Settings menu in network admin. It's not available in individual sites as there is only one htaccess file per network.

The plugin was originally developed by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/lukenzi">Lukenzi</a> in March of 2011.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've killed my site! Help!? =

Nothing is lost or deleted. You can easily get your site back.
You're probably getting an error 500 or a white screen (of death). First connect to your site via FTP and locate the .htaccess file. Delete it, or rename it. Try the site again - it should open. If it did locate the backup of the old, working .htaccess file in `/wp-content/htaccess-editor-backups/` copy the file to your site's root folder and you're back in business.

= I get an error saying the .htaccess file can't be edited or created =

Sorry, we can't change the file access privileges set by your server. You'll have to edit the file via FTP.
